        Write down what you STAND FOR on this planet. Find it, breathe it, live it. If you were to die tomorrow you would know that this body, this life was not in vain as you stood for this purpose through all obstacles.

        Grow as an independent being and help people I care about grow. My memory will disappear soon enough after my last breath, my money won't serve me anymore, my stuff won't last forever but if I did exist for those few people I'll be done here. I might
        not change the world but I do hope I'll change their world.

      <ul>
        <li>To me, I'll be courageous enough to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me</li>
        <li>To others, I'll strive for an open communication by listening, understanding only then responding with honesty</li>
        <li>In action, I'll act my words and live my acts</li>
